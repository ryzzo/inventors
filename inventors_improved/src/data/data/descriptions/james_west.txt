The inventor is credited with creating a device that is now used in 90 percent of all microphones. Along with fellow scientist Gerhard M. Sessler, He developed the electret microphone in 1962. Six years later, it was in mass production. And it’s not just used in microphones like the ones you see at concerts—it’s also an important part of many hearing aids, telephones, camcorders, and baby monitors. During his career, he has developed more than 250 patents and supported initiatives to bring more women and people of color into STEM fields.
