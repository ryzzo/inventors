If youâ€™ve ever used a Miracle Mop, you have her to thank. The 67-year-old created the innovative cleaning tool in 1990, which she marketed and sold herself. A couple of years after inventing the device, she appeared on QVC to sell it, where more than 18,000 mops were sold within a half hour. In addition to the Miracle Mop, Mangano is the creator of Rolykit, Huggable Hangers, and Forever Fragrant.
