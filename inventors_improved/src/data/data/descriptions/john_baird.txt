Philo T. Farnsworth is famous for his work on the electric television, but his work on the mechanical television came first. In the early 1920s, he started experimenting with the idea of transmitting moving images along with sound. By 1927, heâ€™d transmitted sound and images over more than 400 miles of telephone wire, and the following year, he sent the first television transmission across the ocean. This early form of TV was used by the BBC for a few years before they switched to electronic television technology.
