He is best known for being an inventor in the agricultural space. When the blacksmith noticed he was often making the same repairs to wood and cast-iron plows used by farmers, he began experimenting with more durable plow designs, which he then sold to local farmers. His steel plows exploded in popularity among many farmers, with Deereâ€™s company (also called John Deere) producing 1,600 plows in 1850. That same year, the company started producing other tools in addition to plows.
