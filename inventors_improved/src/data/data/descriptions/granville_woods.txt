His work was instrumental in the development of the telephone and electric transit systems. He invented a telephone transmitter—which was later purchased by fellow inventor Alexander Graham Bell—and the induction telegraph, which allowed people to communicate by voice over telegraph wires. He also invented a power pick-up device, which is the basis for the “third rail” used by electric-powered transit systems, along with an improved air-brake system.
