Communication technology wouldn’t be what it is today without his work. He was a physicist who invented the first effective systems of radio communication. In 1901, he sent and received the first wireless message across the Atlantic Ocean, which disproved a widespread belief that the Earth’s curvature would pose an issue in transmitting messages. In 1909, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics alongside Karl Braun and went on to help establish the British Broadcasting Company in 1922.
