Photography was forever changed by him, who invented the Kodak camera. His goal was to make photography more accessible to the public, and itâ€™s fair to say he succeeded. He created a gelatin-based paper film and a device for coating dry plates. Later, he patented a roll-holder device that made cameras smaller and cheaper. He also worked with a chemist to create a new type of flexible film that could be inserted into cameras, and in 1900, he launched the Brownie camera, which became especially popular with servicemen.
