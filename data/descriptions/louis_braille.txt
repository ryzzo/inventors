The inventor revolutionized communication when he created the raised-dot codes we know as Braille. He was blinded in an accident when he was 3 years old and went on to attend the National Institute for Blind Youth in Paris when he was 10. He met Charles Barbier, who had invented a code of raised dots during his time in the French Army in hopes that it could be used by soldiers to communicate silently at night. It never succeeded as a military tool, but Braille was able to use the basis of Barbier’s idea to develop a much simpler system of raised dots that’s now used worldwide.
