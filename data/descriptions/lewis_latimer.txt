The inventor was instrumental in the process of bringing two major inventions to life: the telephone and the light bulb. He worked with Alexander Graham Bell to draft the patent for Bell’s design of the telephone, and later, he worked with Thomas Edison to develop and defend the idea for the light bulb. When he wasn’t working on his scientific pursuits, he taught mechanical drawing and English to recent immigrants in New York City.
