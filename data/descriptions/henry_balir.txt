The inventor is famous not only for his agricultural devices, but also for the fact that he was one of the first Black Americans to receive a U.S. patent. His first patent was for a wheelbarrow-like corn planter, which allowed farmers to plant their seeds more efficiently. His second patent was for a cotton planter, which split the ground with blades and deposited seeds as it was pulled along by a horse or other animal.
