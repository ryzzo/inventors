He was the creator of multiple inventions, from a hair-straightening formula to the early versions of the traffic light we know today. He also pioneered a breathing device that later became the prototype for gas masks used during World War I. This device was popular among firefighters and rescue workers, though racism caused him to hire a white actor to pose as the “inventor” in order to boost sales. Finally, he invented a more efficient sewing machine, drawing on his experience as a sewing machine mechanic.
