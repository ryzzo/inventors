He was an inventor and businessman whose work revolved around cars, or “horseless carriages” as they were called at the start of his career. In 1908, he introduced the Model T, the first car that was affordable for the average American. In 1913, he launched the first moving assembly line, which decreased the amount of time it took to build a car and made it even cheaper to buy.
