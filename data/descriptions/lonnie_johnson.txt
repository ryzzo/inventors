If you’ve ever enjoyed an epic Super Soaker fight in the backyard, it’s all thanks to him. He worked for the U.S. Air Force and NASA before accidentally creating the water toy we now know and love. He set out to create an environmentally friendly heat pump that relied on water instead of Freon, but when he went to test it in his bathroom, he shot a powerful stream of water from the device, realized he could market this invention as a toy, and sold it to the Larami Corporation in 1989.
